# Project: Social media blog API

A backend for a hypothetical social media app, where usersâ€™ accounts are managed as well as any messages that they submit to the application. The application functions as a micro-blogging or messaging app. In this application, any user can see all of the messages posted to the site, and can see the messages posted by a particular user. With this backend, this information is displayed, while also prcoessing actions like logins, registrations, message creations, message updates, and message deletions.
